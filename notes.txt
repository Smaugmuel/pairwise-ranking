Generate solution and projects:
	cd to project root directory
	Run "cmake -S . -B build"
Build application and tests:
	Solution and project must be generated
	run "cmake --build .\build --config Release"
Run tests:
	Solution and project must be generated (maybe)
	Tests must be built
	Find built test directory, i.e. where enable_testing() is.
	E.g. .\src\test\CMakeLists
	run "ctest --test-dir .\build\src\test --build-config Release"
	or  "ctest --test-dir .\build\src\test --build-config Release --output-on-failure"

Current process to add a new test:
	1. Create test_<my_test_name>.cpp in src\tests
	2. Add test_<my_test_name> to tests list in src\tests\CMakeLists
	3. Re-generate solution and projects (see above)
	To run the test, it must be built (see above)
